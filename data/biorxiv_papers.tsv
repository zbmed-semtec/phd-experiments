1	Peptide abundance correlations in metaproteomics enhance taxonomic and functional analysis of the human gut microbiome.	Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is widely used for quantitative protein profiling and has become a powerful tool for studying protein interactions. However, most current research focuses on single-species proteomics to study protein interactions. Protein interactions within more complex microbiomes, composed of 100’s of bacterial species, remain largely unexplored. The human gut microbiome, closely linked to human health and disease, has become a key area of study using metaproteomics. Yet, due to the complexity of the microbiome, the interactions between gut microbes and their host remain largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed peptide abundance correlations within a metaproteomics dataset derived from in vitro cultured human gut microbiomes subjected to various drug treatments. Our analysis revealed that peptides from the same protein or taxon exhibited correlated abundance changes. By using t-SNE for visualization, we generated a peptide correlation map in which peptides from the same taxon formed distinct clusters. Furthermore, peptide abundance correlations enabled genome-level taxonomic assignments for a greater number of peptides. In single-species subsets of the dataset, peptide correlation networks constructed using taxon-based normalized peptide abundance (TNPA) linked peptides from functionally related proteins. These networks also provided insights into the potential functions of previously uncharacterized proteins. Altogether, our study demonstrates that analyzing peptide abundance correlations enhances both taxonomic and functional analyses in human gut metaproteomics research.
2	Real-time analysis of nanopore-based metagenomic sequencing from orthopaedic device infection.	Prosthetic joint infections are clinically difficult to diagnose and treat. Previously, we demonstrated metagenomic sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq replicates the findings of current gold standard microbiological diagnostic techniques. Nanopore sequencing offers advantages in speed of detection over MiSeq. Here, we compare direct-from-clinical-sample metagenomic Illumina sequencing with Nanopore sequencing, and report a real-time analytical pathway for Nanopore sequence data, designed for detecting bacterial composition of prosthetic joint infections. DNA was extracted from the sonication fluids of seven explanted orthopaedic devices, and additionally from two culture negative controls, and was sequenced on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION platform. A specific analysis pipeline was assembled to overcome the challenges of identifying the true infecting pathogen, given high levels of host contamination and unavoidable background lab and kit contamination. The majority of DNA classified (>90%) was host contamination and discarded. Using negative control filtering thresholds, the species identified corresponded with both routine microbiological diagnosis and MiSeq results. By analysing sequences in real time, causes of infection were robustly detected within minutes from initiation of sequencing. We demonstrate initial proof of concept that metagenomic MinION sequencing can provide rapid, accurate diagnosis for prosthetic joint infections. We demonstrate a novel, scalable pipeline for real-time analysis of MinION sequence data. The high proportion of human DNA in extracts prevents full genome analysis from complete coverage, and methods to reduce this could increase genome depth and allow antimicrobial resistance profiling.
3	New gene annotations for three pea aphid genome assemblies allow comparative analyses of genes and gene family evolution.	Reliable genome annotation is crucial for analyses of gene function, conservation, and evolution. Factors such as the sequencing technology used to create the assembly and the amount of duplicated sequence within the genome of interest can have a large impact on the quality of gene annotations. In particular, short read-based assemblies tend to mis-assemble duplicated genes as single loci, a problem that requires additional long read sequencing to resolve. Pea aphids exhibit a high level of gene duplication, resulting in mis-assembly and mis-annotation of genes in the short read reference genome. Here, we re-annotate the pea aphid reference genome, along with two long read pea aphid genomes, to facilitate future analyses of gene duplication and function in pea aphids. We use an integrated approach, consolidating both ab initio and RNAseq-based annotations into unified gene models. The new annotations contain genes that were missing, mis-annotated, or mis-assembled in the reference, and are generally consistent across assemblies, showing very good agreement between the long read assemblies. Our annotation method is sensitive enough to refine existing gene models, uncovering alternatively used promoters and isoforms, and aids in finding gene duplications. These data provide a useful supplement to the existing reference annotations and a new comparative framework for discovery and analysis of gene function and duplication in this important emerging model insect.
4	MGMG: Cell Morphology-Guided Molecule Generation for Drug Discovery.	Designing novel molecules with desired bioactivity remains a fundamental challenge in drug discovery. Most molecular design methods follow target-based drug discovery paradigms that rely on well-defined drug targets, thereby limiting their applicability to diseases lacking known targets or reference compounds. Here we introduce Morphology-Guided Molecule Generation (MGMG), a phenotypic drug discovery–oriented approach that integrates cellular morphological profiles from compound treatments with molecular textual descriptions without requiring molecular target information. Cell morphology offers the guidance on desired bioactivity-relevant phenotypic effects, while textual descriptions provide direct and interpretable cues about molecular structure. Leveraging complementary structural and bioactivity context, MGMG significantly enhances molecule generation performance, especially in scenarios where textual descriptions are under-informative or morphological signals are weak. MGMG can also be applied to genetic perturbations, enabling activator design from gene overexpression morphology without requiring knowledge of reference compound structure. In addition, in silico docking demonstrates that MGMG-generated molecules, despite lacking target information, exhibit binding affinities comparable to reference compounds, preserving key interactions while introducing structural diversity. Overall, MGMG jointly utilizes morphological and textual description inputs to guide molecule generation, enabling diverse, bioactivity-aware compound design in a target-agnostic fashion.
5	Mapping the Inter- and Intra-genic Codon Usage Landscape in Homo sapiens.	The redundancy of the genetic code permits multiple codons to specify a single amino acid, but codon selection is far from random and reflects underlying functional significance. Most lifeforms exhibit the phenomenon of codon usage bias, where the usage of certain codons is favored over others and hence used more often throughout the genome. Codon bias is thought to provide a layer of post-transcriptional regulation that shapes mRNA stability, translation kinetics and co-translational protein folding. Despite extensive characterization of codon bias in bacteria, viruses and various model organisms, its prevalence and functional consequences remain understudied in humans. Accordingly, this study seeks to (1) characterize the genome-wide distribution of key codon bias metrics in humans, (2) investigate how codon usage correlates with protein structural features, and (3) assess whether genes with exceptionally restricted codon repertoires are selectively constrained against synonymous mutations. Our study finds that codon usage bias is pronounced in structured protein domains relative to intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) (Cliffs = 0.26; p < 2.2); that the most frequently used codons are supported by higher tRNA gene copy numbers (p < 0.05); and that genes exhibiting extreme codon bias (high ENC) harbor significantly fewer synonymous variants than expected (r = 0.28, p < 2.2). Collectively, our findings position codon usage bias as a central, evolutionarily conserved regulator of translational efficiency, protein folding, and genomic integrity in humans. This offers a new framework for interpreting synonymous variation and guiding future efforts in functional genomics.
