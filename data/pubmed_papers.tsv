28600191	Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticle-mediated therapeutics delivery: advances and challenges.	With rapid advances in nanomedicine, lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs) have emerged as promising nanocarriers for several biomedical applications, including therapeutics delivery and biomedical imaging. Significant research has been dedicated to biomimetic or targeting functionalization, as well as controlled and image-guided drug-release capabilities. Despite this research, the clinical translation of LPHNP-mediated therapeutics delivery has progressed incrementally. In this review, we discuss the recent advances in and challenges to the development and application of LPHNPs, present examples to demonstrate the advantages of LPHNPs in therapeutics delivery and imaging applications, and discuss the translational obstacles to LPHNP technology.
19243676	Variations in fresh fruit and vegetable quality by store type, urban-rural setting and neighbourhood deprivation in Scotland.	Neighbourhood differences in access to fresh fruit and vegetables may explain social inequalities in diet. Investigations have focused on variations in cost and availability as barriers to the purchase and consumption of fresh produce; investigations of quality have been neglected. Here we investigate whether produce quality systematically varies by food store type, rural-urban location and neighbourhood deprivation in a selection of communities across Scotland.
10793294	Responses of the rabbit tracheal epithelium in vitro to H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress.	A model of rabbit tracheal epithelial (RTE) cells in primary culture was used to characterize specific and repair responses of airway epithelial cells to oxidative stress. Two well-known reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating systems were used: H(2)O(2) alone or in combination with Fe(2+) to produce the hydroxyl radical. RTE cells exhibited lipid peroxidation when exposed to H(2)O(2) + Fe(2+). Moreover, catalase (CAT) activity decreased after a 1-hour treatment in 3-day-old cultures but increased in 7-day-old cultures which have higher antioxidant enzyme activities. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was never affected. In addition, RTE cells displayed a repair response leading to squamous metaplasia. H(2)O(2) + Fe(2+) treatment resulted in a time-dependent increase in the steady-state level of c-myc mRNA while c-jun and c-fos were not activated. Moreover, a chronic exposure induced the expression of the squamous phenotype characterized by the expression of the cytokeratin 13 confirmed both at the message and protein levels. RTE cells in primary culture react early to H(2)O(2) + Fe(2+) exposure by an increase in c-myc expression and by modifications in CAT activity. Further, a lipid peroxidation occurs and the tracheal epithelium evolves to squamous metaplasia.
24463521	Within-group male relatedness reduces harm to females in Drosophila.	To resolve the mechanisms that switch competition to cooperation is key to understanding biological organization. This is particularly relevant for intrasexual competition, which often leads to males harming females. Recent theory proposes that kin selection may modulate female harm by relaxing competition among male relatives. Here we experimentally manipulate the relatedness of groups of male Drosophila melanogaster competing over females to demonstrate that, as expected, within-group relatedness inhibits male competition and female harm. Females exposed to groups of three brothers unrelated to the female had higher lifetime reproductive success and slower reproductive ageing compared to females exposed to groups of three males unrelated to each other. Triplets of brothers also fought less with each other, courted females less intensively and lived longer than triplets of unrelated males. However, associations among brothers may be vulnerable to invasion by minorities of unrelated males: when two brothers were matched with an unrelated male, the unrelated male sired on average twice as many offspring as either brother. These results demonstrate that relatedness can profoundly affect fitness through its modulation of intrasexual competition, as flies plastically adjust sexual behaviour in a manner consistent with kin-selection theory.
25984610	[The role of alexithymia as a psychosomatic factor in psoriasis].	Alexithymia is the lack of mental representations of emotions leading to limited ability to understand and regulate these and can contribute to the development or maintenance of a psychosomatic illness. The aim of the study was to demonstrate that alexithymia is a feature that occurs more frequently in patients with psoriasis and that the coexistence of alexitimia-psoriasis is associated with high levels of trait anxiety.
