1	Lipid Nanoparticle-Mediated Delivery of GLP-1 Analogues for the Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus: Insights into Efficacy and Mechanisms.	Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia and impaired insulin signaling. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues have emerged as promising therapeutics for glycemic control. Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs) have been explored as delivery vehicles for GLP-1 analogues due to their biocompatibility and controlled release properties. In preclinical studies, LPHNP-mediated GLP-1 delivery improved glucose tolerance and reduced HbA1c levels in rodent models of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The nanoparticles (NPs) facilitated enhanced cellular uptake in pancreatic β-cells and demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity. Interestingly, this delivery system also modulated inflammatory markers, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, which are elevated in DM. Previous approaches using free GLP-1 exhibited rapid degradation and limited therapeutic efficacy; the NPs overcame these limitations. Abbreviations used in this study include DM (diabetes mellitus), T2DM (type 2 diabetes mellitus), LPHNPs (lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles), and NPs (nanoparticles). The disease pathology was also evaluated in human islet cell cultures, where LPHNPs demonstrated targeted delivery and improved insulin secretion. This study highlights the potential of nanoparticle-mediated therapeutics for diabetes and provides a rich set of entities, abbreviations, and coreferential expressions suitable for testing biomedical NLP pipelines.
